    """Start generating a new certificate for the user.

    Certificate generation is allowed if:
    * The user has passed the course, and
    * The user does not already have a pending/completed certificate.

    Note that if an error occurs during certificate generation
    (for example, if the queue is down), then we simply mark the
    certificate generation task status as "error" and re-run
    the task with a management command.  To students, the certificate
    will appear to be "generating" until it is re-run.

    Args:
        request (HttpRequest): The POST request to this view.
        course_id (unicode): The identifier for the course.

    Returns:
